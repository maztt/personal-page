        <h1>Who I Am</h1>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>JÃºlio</strong>, a former project manager who found himself in programming due to <strong>personal development</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am originally from business administration and that's where I developed passion for topics like <strong>strategy</strong>, <strong>leadership</strong>, <strong>people</strong>, <strong>processes</strong>, <strong>project management</strong> and <strong>solving problems</strong>  in general. I still love it and imagine myself mixing both areas someway in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back in 2020 I had my first experience with the methodologies of <strong>agile</strong>, <strong>lean</strong> and <strong>design thinking</strong> and I guess that's what made me more <strong>open-minded</strong> about the inumerous possibilities out there in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though <strong>I started studying programming in May 2022</strong>, my first programming experience was back in a workshop in October 2021. The first language I managed to learn was <strong>Python</strong> and that's because at the time I was so much into <strong>data analysis</strong>, <strong>processes</strong> and <strong>automation</strong>. It was a good run, but I guess <strong>JavaScript</strong> kind of caught my attention more. I liked how the stack was so broad and how many opportunities I could explore within it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right after taking the risk and surviving the <strong>#100DaysOfCode</strong> challenge, I found out I liked the concept of being a <strong>full stack developer</strong> once I always liked to follow the whole creation end to end, so here I am.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish I could tell you more but I don't want to be exhaustive, so why don't we chat?
