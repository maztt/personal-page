        <h1>Who I Am_</h1>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>JÃºlio</strong>, a former project manager who found himself in programming due to <strong>personal development</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm originally from business administration and have a passion for <strong>strategy</strong>, <strong>leadership</strong>, <strong>people</strong>, <strong>processes</strong>, <strong>project management</strong> and <strong>problem-solving</strong>. I still love these topics and imagine mixing both areas in some way in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back in 2020 I had my first experience with the methodologies of <strong>agile</strong>, <strong>lean</strong> and <strong>design thinking</strong> and I guess that's what made me more <strong>open-minded</strong> about the numerous possibilities out there in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although <strong>I started studying programming in May 1st, 2022</strong>, my first programming experience was back in a workshop in October 2021. At the time, I was so much into <strong>data analysis</strong>, <strong>processes</strong>, and <strong>automation</strong>, and that's why I managed to learn Python. However, <strong>JavaScript</strong> caught my attention more due to its broad stack and many opportunities to explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          After taking a leap of faith and surviving the <strong>#100DaysOfCode</strong> challenge, 
          I discovered my passion for being a <strong>full-stack developer</strong>. 
          I've always enjoyed seeing a project through from start to finish, and this role allows me to do just that. 
          That's why I'm here, ready to take on new challenges and grow in my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish I could tell you more but I don't want to be exhaustive, so why don't we chat?

        <h1>Skills & Experiences_</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>I'm currently looking for my first opportunity in software development.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Having more than five years of work experience, I've been fortunate enough to work in various areas of business, continuously improving my communication, leadership, problem-solving, and planning skills. 
          As a result, I can effectively communicate with diverse people and departments, forging strong connections that lead to creative and powerful innovations.
        </p>
        <p>          
          I have an insatiable thirst for knowledge and am always on the lookout for new and different experiences to learn from. 
          Additionally, I am constantly refining my JavaScript tech stack, pushing myself to be better and better.
